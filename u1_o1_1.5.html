<h4>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h4>

<p>
    Selecting the correct IT system for your project is vital, get it wrong and it could jeopardise the whole project before it has even begun. To help with the selection process a few key things need to be considered in order to make the correct choice. These key things include functionality, compatibility, integration, scalability as well as security and the management and reporting capabilities. It is the same when deciding on what technology is right for the job. To make this choice there are certain questions you need to ask yourself and answer in order to make the right decision. Firstly you shouldn't just blindly copy what other people have done in the past, just because it worked for them doesn’t mean that it will automatically work for you. Being aware of the current trends in the industry will help you get a better understanding of the popularity of the different technologies, but you also have to be careful that you don't get overly influenced by these because trends can come and go very quickly. You should also try and choose technology that fits the core values of the company, this helps to define the sort of culture you want for your team. Researching the technology’s adoption lifecycle and where you are in it, this will help you determine if 12 months down the line it is going to become obsolete and therefore ruin your project. Probably one of the important ones is to discuss your project and seek the advice from a developer who has had experience of using a wide variety of different technologies. This advice could be invaluable and more use than just researching yourself.

        Trello has been invaluable in helping me use Kanban planning. It has given me the ability to break down the project into bite size chunks that are easily followed and completed rather than looking and dealing with the project as a whole.

        Git is a Version Control System. That basically means it helps to manage our files within our project. It helps developers because when they are working on a project they tend to constantly improve it by adding new features or just try things out and sometimes they don’t work and you end up wanting to go back to the original. This is where Version Control helps because it tracks every change that has been done and lets the developer go back to the original version no matter the amount of times it has been changed.

        Whereas GitHub is an online service for version control using Git. It basically links developers all around the world so they can network and share code with each other. This helps if you need any issues identifying and also to improve your code. It can be a place where you can show off your projects with the aim of getting noticed by any potential employers.
