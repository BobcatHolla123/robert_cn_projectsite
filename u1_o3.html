<h4>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h4>

<h4>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efciency – could you have been more efcient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h4>

<div>

        I believe if this was a team project the outcome could have been more complex. This is down to being able to play to each of the team members strengths as well as being able to break the project into smaller individual chunks. Being able to break down the project into smaller chunks means the workload is spread out more which gives each member more time to complete less tasks, which in turn would increase the quality and complexity of their work. Trello has helped to improve productivity because I have been able to note any issues or tasks that I need to complete and put them in an order. This has stopped me from procrastinating and wasting time on trying to think what my next task is.

<h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        Making sure regular short breaks are taken away from the computer screen can help improve productivity and efficiency. This is so you can give your eyes a rest from the screen and can stop headaches from developing. It can also help to clear your mind, if you are stuck on a problem that you can’t solve having a short break away from it to clear your mind means when you come back to it you can potentially see it in a different light. Constant research to improve your skills and also for inspiration can improve productivity and efficiency. This helps because you are constantly broadening your knowledge and skills so that things start to become second nature to you. So things you potentially could have got stuck on and spent time on trying to figure out in the past are now easily solved meaning the time saved can be used more efficiently.
