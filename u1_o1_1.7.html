<h4>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        As with the majority of things in life, digital projects have to follow a set of strict laws and regulations. You have a legal obligation to follow them and failing to do so can result in costly consequences. One is to make you identify your business/who you work for. This falls under the Companies Act 2006 and is one of the U.K’s longest pieces of legislation. It basically forces you to disclose certain information about your company that is easily found by the user, this is usually done in the form of a Contacts page. You must include information like the company name, the registered office address and the VAT number. One of the major ones in my eyes is Copyright and Trademark infringements. You have to make sure and double check that any content or imagery are free to use and don’t belong to anyone and if it does belong to anyone you get their permission to use it before going ahead. There is also a lot of legislation surrounding users data, whether it is how the data is collected, how it is stored, what it is used for and if it is shared or not. Due to the importance of users data a new regulation was introduced, called GDPR.

    <p>
        GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is a European Union legislation that started on 25th May 2018. It is a legislation to help control and regulate the processing of personal data. Personal data is referred to as any information that relates to an identified person or information that can be used to identify a person. It is seen to benefit the end user rather than an organisation because it gives the user a greater degree of control of what and how their data is processed. It gives them more rights and means they can have a better insight into what data is stored about them and how it is being used and ultimately giving them the power to either restrict or totally stop data about them from being processed. It means that now data flow designs have to be implemented into all projects. Projects have to factor in data minimization, which means the extent of collected data, the purposes of its processing, and their retention all have to be reduced to the absolute minimum. Failing to comply with the regulations can also have a negative impact on the company, both in money and user confidence. They could also be hit with massive financial sanctions for not following the regulations.
