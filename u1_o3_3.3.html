<h4>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        Next time the biggest change I would make to improve productivity would be to make it a team project rather than it just being me. The productivity would be improved by constantly keeping in touch via zoom so that ideas can be generated and bounced back and forward between team members as well as any issues arising can be discussed and dissected to find a solution much quicker. We could keep an eye on each other to make sure we take regular breaks and are keeping hydrated. Also being able to have other people to talk to not just about the project but day to day life can improve each members moral and they can form a social bond that can be carried on outside of the project.

<h4>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        There are different methods that can be used to test your digital solution. The methods are used at different points during the development and are done to make sure everything is functioning correctly and there aren't any bugs that need to be amended. One method is the Unit Test and this is one of the most basic tests done at the developer level. It is done by isolating selected code and running it outside the whole project. It only focuses on a small amount of functionality but is only testing the interaction between the code and memory. Another method is the Functionality Test, this checks if the output is what the developer expects it to be. The last test to be done is the Acceptance Test, this is when every feature is checked from the user’s perspective by the testing team. This test helps to detect any crashes and the flow of the site.

    <p>
        All throughout the development of my site I continuously tested it. If I made any changes to the workings of the site or how it looked visually I tested it to make sure the outcome was correct for the end user. I let my friend and Grandma go on the final version so that I could get some outside feedback from the perspective of an end user rather than just going off my instincts.
