<h4>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h4>

<h4>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>

<div class="quote">
    “Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution.”
</div>

<p>
    The quote above, I believe, sums up the purpose of and more importantly how much IT is needed in modern business. In my eyes it is saying that IT is central and the key to the success of any business. Without IT it could be said that businesses would simply stop due to it being used all throughout a business, from top to bottom. From the phone systems the receptionist uses, the internet that connects everyone inside and out of the business down to the finance department so people are able to get paid. It is commonly used to deal with a business’ data, be it receiving it, storing it, processing it, reviewing it or manipulating it. Being able to use IT for these, usually repetitive, actions rather than it being down to a human means generally either hardly any or no mistakes are made and it can be done far quicker and continuously if needed. Being able to do things quicker saves time for the business which then translates into money either being saved or being able to be used in other areas.

<h4>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
    successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What
    skills?</h4>
<p>
Most digital projects go through the same 5 step process;
<ul>
    <li>Scoping - idea creation and brainstorming, initial costs and initial requirements.</li>
    <li>Planning - functionality and the map to get there, wireframe is created as well as user journey</li>
    <li>Development - natural progression from backend to frontend, idea finally refined and final product produced</li>
    <li>Testing and deployment - final stage before product in the hands of the user. Most important part is checking that there aren't any bugs or faults. Then it goes live</li>
    <li>Maintenance - continuous improvement of functionality and stability and offering any support for the product.</li>
</ul>
There are several management methodologies that a project manager can implement on the project to help define the tasks as well as split and control the workflow. The 3 main methodologies are Waterfall, Kanban and Scrum. It is best to fit the methodology to the project rather than the other way round and it is also thought that customisation is the better approach, picking which works best for the project from each of the methodologies and then combining them.
<br>
<br>
Waterfall is better for projects that are simple and unchanging because it is a linear process where each task is started and completed in order and in order to redo a task you can’t just go back a step the project has to be started from the beginning again. 
<br>
<br>
Kanban is a framework that helps to optimise the workflow. The workflow is documented and tracked and consistently updated by the manager. The goal is to limit the amount of work at each step by breaking it down into as many small steps as possible. The team can then reflect on their current progress and make small changes. Kanban works best for projects with quick changing requirements but strict roles are not needed.
<br>
<br>
Scrum is a structured model designed for complex projects with a high level of uncertainty. Constant prioritisation and ongoing planning all based on user interaction is key to this methodology.
<br>
<br>
There are numerous skills needed to be able to complete a digital project, some more important than others. One of the more important ones I believe is organisation. This is key so the project has a set structure that everyone involved can follow and they know exactly what, when and where things need to happen. Linked in to this you also have time keeping, so the project stays on the right track, as well as communication and teamwork, that is important so the right message is received and the team knows exactly what is expected of them. Prioritisation is also key so that everyone knows the order of what is important to the project and the order of their tasks to be completed. Next, being able to research efficiently and thoroughly at the start of the project, in the long run, will help to save time and money being wasted. You need to know about the systems and platforms that you or your team are going to be using as well as the pros and cons of these to think about potential risks but also in case you need to present your knowledge to your team, clients or suppliers. Creativity is also huge, being able to create something that is visually and contextually appealing to people but also being able to translate your vision in your head onto paper or a screen. Critical thinking is also important, this is being able to give an objective analysis and evaluation of something in order to improve it. Finally the technical skill to be able to take a design and translate that into a working usable model. Usually time would be spent by the project manager building a team that encompasses all these skills, choosing individuals based on their skill set, so that the project wasn’t resting on only one person's shoulders.
