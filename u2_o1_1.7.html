<h4>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        With there being so many different file types it helps to know which are the most appropriate to use for a website. Below are just a few;
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <ol>
        <li>JPEG - it stands for Joint Photographics Expert Group.This is the most popular choice for saving photographs because they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. They have a good level of flexible compression which means they are able to be shrunk to a smaller file size without having any negative effects on the image or the page load speed. But when dealing with graphics or text they aren’t the best option because they use lossy compression. Meaning when they are saved they lose a lot of information making text or lines of graphics blurry.</li>
        <li>PNG - this file type is suitable for images, graphics and text. They can give you control over transparency, which JPEG can't, so it makes them perfect for logos. One downside to PNG’s is that some web browsers don’t support them so if you view them on a browser that doesn’t they simply won’t appear.</li>
        <li>GIF - these tend to be much smaller file sizes and aren’t capable of containing millions of colours. They support transparency so are useful for small logos or graphics. They are used to place lots of small graphics, for navigation or buttons, all on the same page due to their size. They can be animated so can be used for moving images.</li>
    </ol>
