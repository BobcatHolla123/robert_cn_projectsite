<h4>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints afecting websites</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        Copyright is a form of intellectual property. It means that if you create an image or produce text based work you can protect it and gain the recognition you deserve. You protect it from being used or stolen and passed off as someone else’s work and them gaining all the credit. It means that the user of the material must clearly cite who made the original content as well as direction to the original source. The use of images on websites is seen as a must, it helps to make the site more interesting as well as break up large chunks of text. To make sure you don’t fall into the trap of Copyright abuse, spending a little more time searching and seeking out royalty free imagery can inevitably save time in the long run regarding infringements. The easiest way to avoid image infringements is to take pictures and create your own images and artwork and use those instead. That way you know for sure you aren’t using anyone else’s imagery and you own the intellectual properties of it.

<h4>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        When designing a website you have to make sure that anyone can access it and it doesn’t exclude people who may have disabilities. This is so the footfall can be maximised and there is no  limit to the potential reach. Probably the most important accessibility issue is with regards to the navigation, and applies to all users whether they have a disability or not. If the navigation system isn’t simple then some of the site's content may never be accessed. A way this can be improved is by making sure the site can be navigated by only using the keyboard and pressing the tab key, which moves the user logically through the navigation. Landmarks can also be used to improve accessibility because they give the user help to navigate a page. Landmarks can be defined as special labels that are included within the code that provide navigational indicators to the user and helps them to navigate the site. Another issue surrounds text and how it is presented. The size of the text should be large enough to be easily read and it should be able to easily be enlarged or made smaller by the user. It should also be able to be displayed clearly when transferred across different devices. There should be a proper colour contrast between the colour of the text and the colour of the background so people with visual impairments like colour blindness don't have an issue reading it. Using images to convey meaning or using them for navigation can prevent people from properly accessing information as well. A way to  solve this is to add a text description to an image so people who are visually impaired can understand what is being displayed.The use of multimedia can also cause accessibility issues. If you are displaying a video or using audio, using transcripts to go along side it will mean people who have hearing difficulties are able to understand what is going on.
