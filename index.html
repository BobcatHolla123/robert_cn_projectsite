    For most of my life I have had an interest in all things computers. From an early age I remember my Grandad’s house just littered with computer parts because he built PC’s in his spare time.

<h4>Growing Up</h4>

<p>
    As I grew older my interest leaned towards computer games, firstly online RPG games on PC and then secondly over to game consoles. Starting with the GameBoy, moving across to the Playstation 1, 2 and 3 and now finally settling on the Xbox One. I believe it was the escapism that drew me towards computer games, being magically transported to the middle ages fighting with swords and shields and then the next minute in the modern day running down the wing setting up Ronaldo to score the winning goal in the World Cup final.

<h4>My Passion</h4>

<p>
    As the years have progressed the realism has just got better and better to the point now you actually feel and believe you are a part of the game. I have always had a passion for arts and crafts so generally have an appreciation for anything that looks visually stunning. Due to that I unknowingly fell into developing a fascination with web design firstly with the visual aesthetics and then leading to the tactics or tricks the web designer/developers use to improve the footfall on their sites.
