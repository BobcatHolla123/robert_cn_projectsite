<h4>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h4>

<h4>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        I’m currently happy with the IT tools that I have chosen to create my website. I’m finding the more I progress, through trial and error as well as research, I’m discovering and teaching myself the full capabilities of the tools. I hadn't heard of, let alone used Visual Studio Code when it was first introduced. But from being shown the basics and personally being quite inquisitive I feel like I have got a good grasp of it now and that is only improving with time. As I’ve said previously, Trello has become and is invaluable to the planning and development of any project. If I come across something that isn’t quite right while in the middle of another task I have been able to make a note of it on Trello so I can come back to it once I have completed the task I was doing. This has helped to improve the speed and productivity of each task because rather than stopping and starting, and inevitably losing track, I can finish each task and then come back anytime and make amendments to the things I had noticed.

<h4>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h4>

<div>
    <p>
        I believe that all the tools that I used were appropriate for the task. Visual Studio Code was selected because it is the program I am being taught. As I said above once being taught the basics it is quite intuitive and enjoyable to use. I get great satisfaction from seeing the outcome of the code I use but I also find enjoyment in trying to discover any issues when the code I use doesn’t give the outcome I was expecting or in some cases doesn’t even run.

        Using Trello was important to the initial planning but also any changes or amendments that crop up. Using it to use the Kanban planning style worked excellent together. Not only was I able to keep track of where I was up to, I also let my tutor, once I made it public rather than private, keep an eye on my progress and to see if I was having any issues.

        Not being in a classroom or office setting due to the current pandemic, zoom has become a vital tool as well. It has enabled me to have as close as can be face to face contact with my tutor and the other students in my class. It has made conversations, demonstrations and any help being given far easier, and as close to real contact, than if it was all done via text based applications.
